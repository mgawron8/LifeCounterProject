Passion Project: Custom Magic The Gathering Life Counter


Several Common issues can arise while playing the trading card Game Magic the gathering, one of which is keeping track of the Life totals and other changing numbers amongst the players. Some use dice to keep track of these, and some use other apps available on the market.

While these methods can work, I personally find the use of dice to be rather cumbersome to track all these numbers, and the numbers can be accidentally mixed up, causing mistakes to be made.

Meanwhile the use of apps is more common due to the compact style and ease of tracking, however the formats (at least a majority of those available on the Iphone Appstore) of these only allow a maximum of 4 people, and the format is set to a square shape with just the corners, where outside of a standard seating arrangement can also cause confusion.

This new life counter Website aims to create a customizable layout, allowing the players to layout their statistics overlayed on a virtual table, in order to better represent the layout of the table, as well as allowing the statistics to scale to better allow more spots to be placed on the table. A goal of this app is also to host the table in a virtual room, allowing others to connect and see the table as well from other devices, with the hope of allowing some of the, whilst uncommon, larger groups to play with two devices, in order to allow access to the information to all at the table

My goal is to Accomplish this using Springboot, Java, Javascript

--changes made in order to still produce a functional program, due to the need to use Apple specific projects, which i do not personally own and thus will not have access to after zip code Wilmington--
